## Developer Notes

* **Where is the project brief?**  [`../instructions/project-design-brief.pdf`](../instructions/project-design-brief.pdf).
* **Making Progress**: We understand this work might be difficult. Also, we understand that your project ideas might not be completely worked out. So, we ask that you do the best you can. You will receive specific guidance from your TA and constructive feedback. We are confident that you will succeed! 
* **What should be included in the proposal?** Every proposal will be different. It depends on your particular project.  That said, in the table below you will find the expected report elements.  It is important that you engage with and respond to the the Design Brief. 
* **How should the proposal be formatted?** You should format your proposal using Markdown in this file. You should aim for a professional presentation - clear, concise, interesting, and free of spelling and grammatical errors. 
* **What headings should we use?** As needed, the suggested headings below can be revised and new headings and sub-headings can be added. Please use headings, bullet lists, tables, figures, and other markdown code effectively - seek a professional presentation. 
* **Finishing up.** When you are finished writing and formatting your proposal, save these developer notes(they might useful in the future). Then, delete them.
* **Questions?** If you have questions, please ask your TA or post on Teams.

|Code name| Interest-ing | 
|Project title| How Interest Rates Combat Inflation |
|Authors | Mat Medina, Jaden Wang |
|Affiliation |  INFO-201: Technical Foundations of Informatics - The Information School - University of Washington |
|Date | Winter 2022|
|Abstract | The fed interest rates are a key driving force of the United States economy; from combating inflation to stimulating economic growth, no one move affects the economy more than the federal reserve. That being said, how effective is the adjustment of interest rates really? How does the economy scale with this supposedly highly effective system? We plan on cross analyzing the federal interest rate changes with the rates of economic growth, decay, and inflation. |
|Keywords | 3-5 keywords that summarize your project.  (e.g., "Keywords: human physiology; bicycle exercise; elderly; power and heart rate times-series data") |
|1.0 Introduction | For our Project, Jaden, Matthew, and I are cross-analyzing data on changes in the federal interest rate to data on rates of economic decline, growth, and inflation to explore the effectiveness of the action of adjusting the interest rates by the government. We also plan to explore the consequences and benefits that these adjustments have on the economy as a whole and see how well it scales against the adjustments. The 3 main data sets that we are using for our project are the Federal Reserves Interest Rates, which displays sub data sets such as Unemployment rates and Real GDP as well as displaying the inflation rates set the year to year from 1954 to the present, the Consumer Price Index of all urban consumers in the US, as well as the US Consumer Price Index data sets which displays the average CPI in each city. |
|2.0 Design Situation | Use short sub-sections to describe your topic and the setting (that is, the sociotechnical situation), including project framing, human values, direct and indirect stakeholders, possible harms and benefits. See the Design Brief, section B.3. **Note**: You *must* include three citations to related work (URLs to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press, reseach papers, etc. ). You may find it helpful to include a figure.  (about 400 words) |
|3.0 Research questions | 3-5 research questions. What motivates the questions? Why are they important? See the Deign Brief, section B.4. (about 150 words) |
|4.0 The Dataset | See Design Brief, setions B.5 (_Size and complexity_) and B.6 (_Data provenance_). Use short sub-sections for describing the size and complexity of the dataset and for describing the origins fo the data. (about 400 words) |
|5.0 Expected Implications | Assuming you answer your research questions, briefly describe the expected or possible implications for technologists, designers, and policymakers. (about 150 words) |
|6.0 Limitations | What limitations might you need to address? Briefly discuss. (about 150 words) |
|Acknowledgements | Is there anyone you would like to thank? A librarian who helped you with your research? A Teaching Assistant? A friend who helped you find your data? Say thank you in this section.|
|References | Include citations to your three references. See 2.0 Introduction. If you like, you can cite more than three references.  Please use a standard citation style of your choice.  See [Citing Sources](https://guides.lib.uw.edu/research/citations) at the UW Library. |
