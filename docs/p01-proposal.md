|Code name| Interest-ing | 
|Project title| How Interest Rates Combat Inflation |

|Abstract | The fed interest rates are a key driving force of the United States economy; from combating inflation to stimulating economic growth, no one move affects the economy more than the federal reserve. That being said, how effective is the adjustment of interest rates really? How does the economy scale with this supposedly highly effective system? We plan on cross analyzing the federal interest rate changes with the rates of economic growth, decay, and inflation. |

|1.0 Introduction | For our Project, Jaden, Matthew, and I are cross-analyzing data on changes in the federal interest rate to data on rates of economic decline, growth, and inflation to explore the effectiveness of the action of adjusting the interest rates by the government. We also plan to explore the consequences and benefits that these adjustments have on the economy as a whole and see how well it scales against the adjustments. The 3 main data sets that we are using for our project are the Federal Reserves Interest Rates, which displays sub data sets such as Unemployment rates and Real GDP as well as displaying the inflation rates set the year to year from 1954 to the present, the Consumer Price Index of all urban consumers in the US, as well as the US Consumer Price Index data sets which displays the average CPI in each city. |
|2.0 Design Situation | Use short sub-sections to describe your topic and the setting (that is, the sociotechnical situation), including project framing, human values, direct and indirect stakeholders, possible harms and benefits. See the Design Brief, section B.3. **Note**: You *must* include three citations to related work (URLs to similar work, high quality articles from the popular press, reseach papers, etc. ). You may find it helpful to include a figure.  (about 400 words) |
|3.0 Research questions | For our research questions, we aim to look into our choice of topic while utilizing these three questions as a basis and guide for the information that we would look and dissect into: (1) What are the factors that determines the federal interest rate? (2) What intended effects are considered when calculating the federal interest rate? (3) What sort of outcomes have the shift of the federal interest rate over time caused our economy? We're aiming to answer these questions in hopes of getting a better understanding on how and why we came to be have the amount of federal interest rate that we have today, what it tells us of the current state of the economics of our society, its prior circumstances that might show entail why it grew the way it did, and the future implications for whether it continues to grow at a steady rate, exponentially increases, or unexpectedly diminish. |
|4.0 The Dataset | **Size and Complexity:** For our primary dataset, Federal Reserve Interest Rates, 1954-Present, it contains about 904 Observations, and about 10 variables. Along with our secondary datasets, US Consumer Price Index and Inflation (CPI), Historical Federal Interest Rates-Daily, and U.S. Inflation Data, we'll have a total of 27420 observations, and 17 variables. **Origins:** ***Historical Federal Interest Rates-Daily*** represents the federal interest rate starting from July of the year 1954, it details a the federal funds higher target, lower target, the desired target rate, and the effective rate, along with the Real  GDP, unemployment rates, and the inflation rates. The interest rate data came from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' economic data portal. The gross domestic product data was from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the unemployment and consumer price index data was provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This is published by the Federal Reserve, and is under public domain. ***Federal Reserve Interest Rates, 1954-Present*** similarly represents the federal interest rate starting from July of the year 1954, up to January of 2021, while it is more up to date than the previous dataset, it only contains the interest rate percentage over the months/years. It seems to source from MacroTreneds and was published by Dennis Holeski who aimed to use the dataset as a reference in conjunction with other economic data and indicators. ***U.S. Inflation Data*** represents the consumer price index starting in the January in the year 1913 by the months until the January in the year 2021, the data comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics where it was downloaded into Excel and rearranged by Arpit Verma, a risk modeller at Wells Fargo for the purpose of detailing the Average CPI for all US cities, in a given month since it was first tracked. ***US Consumer Price Index and Inflation (CPI)*** similarly also represents the consumer price index starting in the January in the year 1913 but it only goes up to the January of the year 2014, what this dataset makes up for its unaccounted years is the amount of inflation compared to the previous years but otherwise it tells a similar tale from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This one was published by Bojan Tunguz, a data scientist from Nvidia. |
|5.0 Expected Implications |  |
|6.0 Limitations | Using CPI to measure inflation, however, has many drawbacks. These drawbacks are due to the fact that the Consumer Price Index fails to take into consideration other factors that impact inflation as well such as product quality, new products, substitute products’ availability, and the different spending or buying habits of each individual in a market anywhere in the world. The CPI ignores technological advances or changes that may improve the quality of a certain product which does not necessarily increase in price which solely impacts the CPI. New products that are released in a market do not always make it into the basket of goods used to calculate CPI. Due to the vast and diverse amounts of substitutes currently available in any market for most types of goods, consumers may choose to not purchase what they were initially going to and seek out a cheaper alternative. The CPI cannot accurately account for such shifts of preferences to substitute goods. The actual mix of goods that any individual acquires is on average very different from what the CPI accounts for its basket of goods. Also, the CPI’s basket of goods does not take into account the level of income each individual may have (may be people from lower-income households where they use bigger portions of income on food). These factors may make it difficult to accurately calculate inflation rates with just the CPI because a lack of these factors may overestimate or underestimate the real inflation value. |
